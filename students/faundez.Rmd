**_Is the health of the Chilean ocean changing regionaly?_**
  
  I would like to determine the health of the ocean's regions in Chile. By measuring ocean health across a portfolio of goals I can better understand potential trade-offs between goals and propose management targets for the future.
  

## Techniques

```{r question2, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
 What techniques from the course do you think will be most applicable?

```        
 
Useful techniques will be:

* Tidying up Data
* Visualizing Data
* Interactive Plots and Maps
* Advanced Programming
  
        
## Data

```{r question3, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
What data have you already identified? Feel free to provide a link and/or details on the variables of interest.

```        

I have have idenfied data of jobs, wages and revenues per region in Chile.
  
  The data will be used to calculate the Livelihoods and Economies goal in each region of Chile. This goal focuses on avoiding the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods and productive coastal economies while maximizing livelihood quality. The Status of this goal is the average of the Status of the two sub-goals : livelihoods  (i.e., jobs and wages) and economies (i.e., revenues) using [data](http://www.ine.cl/canales/chile_estadistico/familias/laborales.php)
